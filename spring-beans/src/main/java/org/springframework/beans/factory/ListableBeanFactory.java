/**
 * {@link BeanFactory}接口的扩展将由可以枚举其所有bean实例的bean工厂实现，而不是按照客户端的要求按名称一一尝试。预加载其所有bean定义的BeanFactory实现（例如，基于XML的工厂）可以实现此接口。
 *
 * <p>I如果这是一个{@link HierarchicalBeanFactory}，则返回值<i>不<i>会考虑任何BeanFactory层次结构，但仅与当前工厂中定义的bean有关。也可以使用{@link BeanFactoryUtils}帮助程序类来考虑祖先工厂中的bean。
 *
 * <p>该接口中的方法将仅遵守该工厂的bean定义。他们将忽略通过其他方式
 * （例如{@link org.springframework.beans.factory.config.ConfigurableBeanFactory}的{@code registerSingleton}方法）注册的任何单例bean，
 * 但{@code getBeanNamesForType}和{@代码getBeansOfType}，它也将检查此类手动注册的单例。
 * 当然，BeanFactory的{@code getBean}确实也允许透明访问这种特殊的Bean。
 * 但是，在典型情况下，无论如何，所有bean都将由外部bean定义来定义，因此大多数应用程序不必担心这种区别。
 *
 * <p><b>NOTE:</b>除了{@code getBeanDefinitionCount}和{@code containsBeanDefinition}之外，此接口中的方法并非设计用于频繁调用。实施可能很慢。
